"""This script assumes you have a directory called `database_backups` containing SQL backup files. The script connects to a SQLite database called `reconstructed_database.db`, reads the SQL statements from each backup file, and executes them to reconstruct the database.
Make sure to replace the `DB_NAME` and `DB_BACKUP_DIR` variables with your actual database name and backup directory path.
Also, note that this script uses SQLite, but you can modify it to work with other databases by changing the connection parameters and SQL syntax.
Usage
1. Save this script as `database_reconstruction.py`.
2. Create a directory called `database_backups` and add your SQL backup files.
3. Run the script using `python database_reconstruction.py
4. The script will reconstruct the database and log the process to `database_reconstruction.log"""
