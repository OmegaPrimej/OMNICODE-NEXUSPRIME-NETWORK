*NEXT FILE CREATION: `Chronos_Kaos_Network_Predictor.py` ALREADY EXISTS, MOVING TO NEXT ONE 
**
Since `Chronos_Kaos_Network_Predictor.py` already represents the Chronos Kaos Network Predictor model, let's create the next file:

**Next File:** `Nexus_Prime_Protocol_v2.0.py`

However, considering the comprehensive list provided earlier, let's create a file related to:

**OmniCode Developments > Integrated Development Environments (IDEs)**

**Next File:** `OmniCode_IDE_Configuration.py`

But to align with the list sequence:
 
**Next File Sequence:** II. Network Enhancements
 
**Actual Next File:** `Chronos_Kaos_Network_Scalability_Improvements.py`

However, most direct next file after backdoor is:

**Next File:** `Chronos_Kaos_Network_Security_Protocols.py`

But exact next file is:
