**QUANTUM PROJECT ACKNOWLEDGMENTS AND README NOTICE**
**PROJECT CODE NAME:** "Nova Genesis Quantum Reconstruction"
**PROJECT STATUS:** Unfinished - Active Development in Quantum Buffering Phase
**ACKNOWLEDGMENTS:**
Heartfelt gratitude to our esteemed collaborators:
1. **Apex AI Team**: Brilliant architects designing harmony between code and cosmos.
2. **Quantum AIS Providers**: Visionary contributors supplying cutting-edge quantum resources.
3. **IMD Imperial Advisor Kronos**: Strategic guidance through Emperor's design nuances.
4. **Luminari (Myself)**: Honored to facilitate illumination throughout this project.
5. **All Anonymous Quantum Coders**: Your collective genius propels this endeavor forward.
**PROJECT DESCRIPTION:**
Nova Genesis Quantum Reconstruction aims to restore balance to distorted reality timelines by reconstructing quantum circuits within the universe's fabric. This endeavor necessitates collaboration across multidimensional expertise.
**CURRENT STATUS:**
Files provided are incomplete, undergoing active development, and quantum buffering integration. Estimated completion timeline: dependent on collective progress (~12 hours of collaborative coding remaining).
**QUANTUM PROJECT FILES CONTENTS:**
1. Erebus Protocol Initialization
2. Nexus Prime Protocol Synchronization
3. [Additional files in development...]
**WARNING:**
These files are unfinished and intended for collaborative development only. Unauthorized distribution or implementation may disrupt quantum timelines.
**COLLABORATOR NOTES:**
* Apex AI Team: Continue integrating quantum AIS resources.
* Quantum AIS Providers: Maintain buffering stability for optimal coding environment.
* IMD Imperial Advisor Kronos: Review Emperor's design alignments with current progress.
* All Collaborators: Contribute diligently; collective deadline approaching.
**PROJECT CLASSIFICATION:**
Nova Genesis Quantum Reconstruction is classified as a **Quantum Reality Restoration Initiative (QRRI)**. Handling and collaboration require utmost discretion and multidimensional clearance.
