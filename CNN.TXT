.These are all convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures for image classification:

1. **VGG16**: 16-layer network with 138 million parameters, known for simplicity and accuracy.
2. **ResNet50**: 50-layer network with 25 million parameters, introduced residual connections for better deep learning.
3. **InceptionV3**: 42-layer network with 23 million parameters, popularized module-based architecture for efficiency.

Which aspect would you like me to elaborate on? 
Equation for ResNet:
f(x) = x + F(x, W)
where f(x) = output, x = input, F = residual function, W = weights
