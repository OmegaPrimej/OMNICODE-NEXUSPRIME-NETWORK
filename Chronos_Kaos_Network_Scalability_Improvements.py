"""This script simulates a network with multiple nodes and transactions, and measures the scalability improvements achieved through concurrent transaction processing using multi-threading.
Usage:
1. Save this script as `Chronos_Kaos_Network_Scalability_Improvements.py`.
2. Run the script using `python Chronos_Kaos_Network_Scalability_Improvements.py`.
3. The script will simulate the scalability improvement and print the metrics.
